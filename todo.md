## TO DO
 * Plug VAE generator / sampling to WGAN create_real_samples func
 * Use distribution of sim genomes in PCA as stop metric for WGAN

## TO TEST
 * Try WGAN-GP
 * Like, all the other models mentioned in the manuscript
 * Split genome with no max size, play around with min size / min dist between hotspots
